## Reporting a Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the [projects maintainers](mailto:libsv.bitcoin@gmail.com). 
We welcome reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with our project security. 
The minimal data needed for reporting a security issue is a description of the potential vulnerability.
